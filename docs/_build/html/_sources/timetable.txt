All current features are demonstrated in the tutorial.  As new features appear, the tutorial will be appended.  New programs to the PyQt testsuite will be added as well.

Coming features
---------------

We'd like to see the following features in the first beta release, coming online probably before end of 2018.

- Interserver communication - mirroring and sharing live and file streams using RTSP.
- ValkkaFS filesystem, designed for recording large amounts of video.
- Synchronized recording of several videos into matroska files.
- Picture-in-picture 
- Fisheye projections (trivial to implement as we are using OpenGL textures)
- Support for sound
- An ultralight onvif/soap client library written in python (for PTZ controls, etc.)
- etc.
