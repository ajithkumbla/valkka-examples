Lesson 5 : Transmitting stream
==============================

Sending multicast
-----------------

.. include:: snippets/lesson_5_a.py_

To receive the multicast stream, you need this file, save it as "multicast.sdp":

.. _multicast:

::

  v=0
  o=- 0 0 IN IP4 127.0.0.1
  s=No Name
  c=IN IP4 224.1.168.91
  t=0 0
  a=tool:libavformat 56.36.100
  m=video 50000 RTP/AVP 96
  a=rtpmap:96 H264/90000
  a=fmtp:96 packetization-mode=1
  a=control:streamid=0

Then you can test that the stream is multicasted (while running the python script) with:

::

  ffplay multicast.sdp
  
(feel free to launch this command several times simultaneously)

.. note:: Receiving and recasting the stream can also be done using a single LiveThread only.  This is left as an excercise.
