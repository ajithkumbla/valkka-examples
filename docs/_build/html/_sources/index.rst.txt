Valkka
======

Valkka is a python programming library for creating video surveillance and management solutions for linux desktop in local area / virtual private networks.

Some highlights of Valkka:

- Python3 API, code itself runs at cpp level
- Works with stock OnVif compliant IP cameras
- Create complex filtergraphs for your streams - send stream to screen, to disk or to your module of choice via shared memory
- Share decoded video with python processes across your Linux system
- Plug in your python-based machine vision modules
- Designed for massive video streaming : view and analyze simultaneously a large number of IP cameras
- Recast the IP camera video streams to either multicast or unicast
- Build graphical user interfaces with PyQt, interact machine vision with Qt's signal/slot system and build highly customized GUIs

This documentation is a quickstart for installing and developing with Valkka using the Python3 API.  A Tutorial, a PyQt testsuite and some benchmarking results are provided.
