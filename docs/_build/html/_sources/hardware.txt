Supported hardware
==================

libValkka uses OpenGL and OpenGL texture streaming.   The library needs a robust OpenGL implementation.  As of **Ubuntu 16.04 LTS**, the working graphics drivers are:

- Intel: the stock **i915** driver works nicely
- Nvidia: use **nvidia** proprietary driver (instead of **noveau**)
- ATI: not tested
