AGPL License
------------

If you use libValkka under the terms of the default `AGPL License <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html>`_, then it's your obligation to make your source code public once you deploy the software.

This applies to all cpp and python code you might develop yourself and **that uses libValkka**.

LGPL License
------------

Within the `LGPL license <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.html>`_, you have no obligation to publish your source code.  Only the changes you might make to the underlying libValkka itself, should be made public.

We sell LGPL licenses to individuals and companies.  The price for both is flat 500 EUR + VAT.  With this price, you get an LGPL license for all versions, published during the calendar year of your purchase.

Getting an LGPL license for a certain version(s) of libValkka, means that the license for those versions is valid *foverever* (a direct consequence of the LGPL license).

The LGPL license you purchase, includes LGPL licenses for the following repositories:  `valkka-core <https://github.com/elsampsa/valkka-core>`_ and `valkka-live <https://github.com/elsampsa/valkka-live>`_

(rest of :ref:`our stuff <repos>` is MIT licensed, so it doesn't matter)

FAQ
---

*"I am afraid of recurring yearly license costs.."*

Don't be.  If you bought an LGPL license for say, versions 0.10.0 - 0.13.0, then you'll have that LGPL license for those versions **forever** (this is a direct consequence of the LGPL license).  So no, there are no recurring license costs here.

*"What if you start raising the licensing cost every year?"*

In the unlikely case we'd go greedy, you can still keep on using that version for which you bought the LGPL license in the first place, since that license is valid **forever**.

*"I bought a license for 0.10.0 back in 2019.  A new version 10.2.0 with 16K fisheye projections has been rolled out in 2030.  Am I entitled to have an LGPL License for 10.2.0 ?"*

Nopes.  You need a new license.  Or you can keep on squeezing that old version 0.10.0 forever.

*"I bought a license in May 2019.  Version 0.12.0 with MP4 websocket streaming was published 30.12.2019.  Can I use version 0.12.0?".*

Sure.  You get the LGPL license to all code published during the same calendar year.

*"I bought the LGPL license for year 2019.  I don't want to buy it for 2020 anymore.  Can I still keep on developing my software, based on libValkka?"*

Yes you can.  As mentioned here already quite a few times, that LGPL license you got for certain libValkka versions, does not expire.  It's valid forever - *para siempre*.

*"I bought the LGPL license year 2019.  I don't want to buy it anymore.  Meanwhile, I have developed new features to libValkka.  Is there a problem?*"

No problem, as long as the changes made to the underlying libValkka are made public (that's the requirement of the LGPL license anyway).

*"Are there any restrictions in the number of cameras I can use with libValkka under the license?"*

For god's sake, of course not!  It's just the normal LGPL license!
