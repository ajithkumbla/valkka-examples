Licensing
=========

Copyright
---------

`(C) Copyright 2017 - 2019 Sampsa Riikonen and Valkka Security Ltd.`


AGPL License
------------

If you use libValkka under the terms of the default AGPL License, then it's your obligation to make your source code public once you deploy the software.

This applies to all cpp and python code you might develop yourself and which uses libValkka.

If you're fine with that, then there's no reason to keep on reading this page.


Valkka License
--------------

If you don't want to publish your source code, then you need to purchase a commercial license.

In the case of Valkka, this license is called the **Valkka License**.  

Instead of obscure and long legal text (which we can send you upon request), here are the main features of the **Valkka License**:

1. You have the right to use all cpp and python code in all valkka repositories without restrictions.
2. The only exception to this rule is the **cpp code** at `valkka-core <https://github.com/elsampsa/valkka-core>`_ repository.
3. The copyright of **cpp code modifications and/or any new cpp code implemented to** `valkka-core <https://github.com/elsampsa/valkka-core>`_, must be transferred to us.

An the motivation for this is ..?

With (2 & 3) we simply assure that any bugfix or enhancement made to the cpp core code is available to us and also for the community.

However, if you create a separate cpp module (say, using `valkka-cpp-examples <https://github.com/elsampsa/valkka-cpp-examples>`_ repository), there are no restrictions on your cpp code since it is not part of the valkka-core cpp code.

For license versions and validity the following applies:

4. Licenses are granted per version.  If you get a license for version 0.10.0, then you don't automatically get a license for 0.11.0
5. Licenses do not expire.  If you have a license for a certain version (say, 0.10.0), then its valid forever.
6. When purchasing a license, you will automatically have **Valkka License** for all versions of Valkka, published during the calender year of your purchase.

Number of developers per license:

7. One license entitles a company to use Valkka under the terms of the **Valkka License** for three developers.


Examples
--------

Let's consider some example cases:

*"I bought a license for 0.10.0 back in 2019.  A new version 10.2.0 with 16K fisheye projections has been rolled out in 2030.  Am I entitled to have a Valkka License for 10.2.0 ?"*

Nopes.  You need a new license.  Or you can keep on squeezing that old version 0.10.0 forever.

*"I bought a license in May 2019.  Version 0.12.0 with MP4 websocket streaming was published 30.12.2019.  Can I use version 0.12.0?".*

Sure.  You get a **Valkka License** to all code published during the same calendar year.


Prices
------

There are no fixed prices for **Valkka License**.  It is cheap though.  Contact us at `support-at-dasys.fi <support@dasys.fi>`_

If you're a one-man software boutique, we might even give it for free, or at least, for an exchange of a bounty (see below)


Bounties
--------

Bounties are published regularly at `valkka-core issues <https://github.com/elsampsa/valkka-core/issues>`_

They are bugfixes, small tasks and features we'd like to see in libValkka.

If you succesfully complete a bounty, you'll be granted a commercial license for free.  The duration of the license depends on the specifications of the bounty.
