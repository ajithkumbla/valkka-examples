Distributing
============

(if you just use Valkka with the Python API, no need to be here)

Self-contained package
----------------------

In the :ref:`Installing section <requirements>` we installed Valkka directly from PyPi with "pip3 install ..".  That gives you a "self-contained" python package with both of the binary files:

| **libValkka.so.0** 
| **_valkka_core.so** (libValkka python bindings.  Uses libValkka.so.0)
  
Now both **libValkka.so.0** and **_valkka_core.so** are installed under either of the two locations (depending on your setup):
  
::

  ~/.local/lib/python3.5/site-packages/
  /usr/local/lib/python3.5/dist-packages/

This is sufficient if you do not plan to do any Valkka development at the cpp level.
  
This way however, **libValkka.so.0** is inaccessible to other cpp libraries that might need it (for example, if you're creating your own cpp-based module with a python interface)

Globally installed libValkka
----------------------------
  
If you need direct access to libValkka at cpp level, you should install **libValkka.so.0** from a debian package and the python bindings separately using pip.  This way you'll get:

| **libValkka.so.0** goes to */usr/lib/*
| **_valkka_core.so** goes to *~/.local/lib/python3.5/site-packages/*

Necessary packages are available `here <https://www.dropbox.com/sh/cx3uutbavp2cqpa/AAC_uDh-plu0Oo50r_klYPEXa?dl=0>`_

Download the Valkka debian package and do:
  
:: 

  sudo dpkg -i Valkka*.deb
  sudo apt-get -f install
  
Download also the Valkka python bindings and do:
  
::
  
  pip3 install --upgrade valkka*.tar.gz

  
Compile from source
